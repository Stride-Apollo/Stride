Visualization
=============

Configuration
-------------


Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the visualization post processing tool by executing the command ``make install_vis`` in the root directory of the project.
This will install the binary visualization executable in the install directory, namely in ``vis/visualization``.


Run configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualization is configured via a parameter in the run config file.
The parameter in question is ``run.visualization``. Setting this option to ``1`` will enable the saving of cluster data used by visualization.



Using visualization
-------------------


In order to use the tool, firstly install it by following the instructions in the section above. Make sure that the visualization config run option ``run.visualization`` is enabled as well. 

Run stride as you would normally do. After the simulator has run its course, it has generated the necessary cluster data to CSV files in the ``output`` directory. You can now start the visualization tool by executing ``vis/visualization``. The tool will display the cluster data generated by the simulator.


Overview features
-----------------

World map
~~~~~~~~~

The first thing you see, when running the tool, is a world map. On this map you can see several circles, which represent the clusters saved by the simulator. 

The color of the circles represents the percentage of infected people in the cluster.

Hovering over a cluster displays some useful information, namely the cluster size, the infected count, the cluster ID and its coordinates.


Cluster panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cluster panel can be opened by clicking on a cluster. The cluster panels display a graph showing the evolution of infected persons in that specific cluster, over the simulation. It also displays general information of the cluster.
*If multiple clusters are located on the same coordinates, multiple panels get opened with all the overlapping clusters.*


Sidebar
~~~~~~~

The sidebar can be accessed by clicking on the arrow icon in the top right. The sidebar contains configuration options for the tool and options to display/show different days of the simulation.

The configuration options include:
-  The displayed colors used by the clusters.
-  The sizes of the circles used to display the clusters
-  The animation speed when displaying the different days of the simulation.
-  Display options in order to display certain cluster types.

You can save the configuration options after adjusting them, by clicking ``SAVE CONFIGURATION``. The saved options will be reused for further uses of the tool.
